# Mandelbrot
A Mandelbrot Set Generator.

Requires: PIL/Pillow

A simple (and rather slow) Mandelbrot generator written in python/pillow.

Currently has no control methods, and requires editing source file to change output image.
Viewfield can be moved, but since plane is complex, this is rather counterintuitive - I will implement a tkinter GUI method later on.

Run with python and wait for output image to be saved, enjoy the beauty of fractals!
